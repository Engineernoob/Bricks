The next generation of no-code tools is here - and it's not just about speed, it's about **intelligence**.
Bricks combines AI, design systems, and developer-grade architecture so creators can ship apps faster than ever.

## Why It Matters

No-Code isn't replacing developers; it's expanding what's possible for everyone else. When you can go from **idea → database → deploy** in a single afternoon, you start thinking differently about creativity and execution.

## What's Next

We're building towards a future where AI understands your intent, your data, and your UI - assembles the pieces for you or your team.
**Bricks is that foundation.**
