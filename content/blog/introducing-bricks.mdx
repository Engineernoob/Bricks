title: "Introducing Bricks - Build Your Dream App Brick by Brick"
date: "2025-10-04"
excerpt: "After months of experimenting and designing, Bricks is finally coming to life - a next-generation no-code builder for students, founders and small teams."
---

When I started Bricks, the goal was simple: **make it effortless for anyone to build and deploy a full-stack app without writing a single line of code** - not by hiding complexity, but by visualizing it.

Most "no-code" tools today feel limiting - they stop short when you need logic, data models, or backend integrations.
Bricks changes that.

### âš™ What is Bricks?

Bricks is a **visual full-stack builder** that lets you:

- **Design interfaces** using drag-and-drop components
- **Define your data schema** visually with collections and fields
- **Deploy instantly** with one click (powered by modern cloud infra)
- **Extend with code** when youâ€™re ready (via API and component hooks)

Think of it as the **bridge between Figma and production-ready apps** â€” the clarity of design, the power of engineering.

### ðŸ§© The Stack Behind Bricks

Weâ€™re building Bricks using some of the best open technologies out there:

| Layer        | Technology                  | Purpose                                     |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Auth         | **Clerk**                   | Simple, secure authentication and waitlists |
| Database     | **Neon + Prisma**           | Fast, scalable PostgreSQL                   |
| File Uploads | **UploadThing**             | Handling assets and media                   |
| Payments     | **Polar**                   | Subscriptions and open-source billing       |
| Frontend     | **Next.js + ShadCN + GSAP** | Beautiful, responsive UI                    |
| Hosting      | **Vercel**                  | Lightning-fast deployments                  |

Each choice was intentional â€” modern, open, and built for performance.

### ðŸš€ Whatâ€™s Next

Right now, Bricks is in **private development** â€” weâ€™re finalizing the builder dashboard, schema editor, and live preview system.
A **public waitlist** is open for early access users who want to help shape Bricks from the start.

You can [join the waitlist here](/waitlist).

### ðŸ§  Why Build This?

Iâ€™ve always believed in **tools that empower creators**.
From indie hackers to designers to founders â€” everyone deserves the power to build software, not just engineers.

Bricks is my contribution to that vision â€” the foundation for a future where anyone can go from idea â†’ app â†’ business.

Thanks for being here at the beginning.
Weâ€™re just getting started. ðŸ§±
