Every product has a story — **Bricks began as mine.**
It started with a simple frustration: building apps was too repetitive, too scattered, too slow.
So I asked, _what if we could build like we think?_

## The Early Days

The first prototype was built in a weekend: a drag-and-drop editor wired to Supabase and GSAP animations.
It wasn’t pretty, but it worked.

Today, Bricks uses:

- **Next.js + ShadCN** for the design system
- **Neon + Prisma** for the database layer
- **UploadThing** for media
- **Polar + Clerk** for billing and authentication

## What Drives the Build

Bricks is more than a tool — it’s a reflection of every builder who dreams of shipping without waiting for permission.
