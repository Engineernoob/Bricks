I’ve always believed that _building in public_ is the best growth strategy — not just for marketing, but for alignment.

By sharing our roadmap, updates, and even our mistakes, we:

- Build trust with early adopters
- Attract creators who value transparency
- Keep our priorities real — focused on solving user pain

Bricks is not just software; it’s a conversation with its community.
Every feature starts with a “what if” from our builders.
