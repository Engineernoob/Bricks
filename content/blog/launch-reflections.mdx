Launching Bricks publicly was both terrifying and exhilarating.

## What Worked

- The design system (ShadCN + Tailwind) made UI iteration seamless
- GSAP + Typed.js gave the landing page real personality
- Community waitlist feedback directly shaped onboarding

## What We’d Do Differently

- Start the docs earlier
- Automate releases sooner
- Simplify the database schema from day one

Every launch teaches something.
For Bricks, it taught us that clarity, not perfection, moves you forward.
