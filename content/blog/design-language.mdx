The Bricks interface is intentionally minimal.
Every shade, corner radius, and animation exists to help you think clearly and build confidently.

## The Core Principles

1. **Calm UI:** Reduce visual noise, focus attention.
2. **Cohesion:** Every component feels like it belongs to the same family.
3. **Momentum:** Subtle animations that _feel alive_, not distracting.

## From Prototype to Personality

Bricks isn’t trying to look futuristic — it’s timeless, inspired by productivity tools like Notion and Linear.
Because great design should fade into the background and let your creativity take center stage.
