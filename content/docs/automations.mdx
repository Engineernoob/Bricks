Bricks lets you **automate workflows visually** — connecting triggers and actions between your app, users, and external APIs.

Automations are the glue that turn static apps into living systems. Whether you're sending an email, updating a record, or calling an API — you can build it all in the visual editor.

## ⚙️ Understanding the Automation Flow

Each automation follows a **Trigger → Action** pattern.

| Element       | Description                                                    |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Trigger**   | The event that starts the workflow (e.g., “Form submitted”)    |
| **Condition** | Optional filters to check before continuing                    |
| **Action**    | The task Bricks executes (e.g., “Send email”, “Update record”) |

## 🧩 Creating a New Automation

1. Go to **Automations → New Flow**.
2. Select a **Trigger** (like “New User Signup”).
3. Add one or more **Actions** — e.g., send a welcome email or add to a CRM.
4. Test and enable the automation.

```json
{
  "trigger": "user.signup",
  "actions": [
    { "type": "email.send", "template": "welcome" },
    { "type": "db.insert", "table": "users" }
  ]
}
```

💡 Tip: Each action supports variables and expressions so you can personalize automations dynamically.

🧠 Advanced Logic

Use conditional branches to control flow dynamically:

IF (user.role == "admin") → send admin email
ELSE → send general email

You can also chain automations across projects — Bricks will handle dependencies automatically.

🔌 Integrations

Automations integrate seamlessly with:

Email providers (Resend, Postmark)

Databases (Neon, Supabase)

External APIs (Webhook, REST, GraphQL)

AI agents (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama)

⚡ Testing & Monitoring

Bricks includes built-in logs and replay tools.
You can view automation runs, inspect payloads, and retry failed tasks — all from the dashboard.

🚀 Pro Tip: You can use the Live Mode to debug flows in real time as users interact with your app.

✅ Summary

Automations are your secret weapon.
They keep your app smart, reactive, and alive — so you can focus on ideas, not wiring.
