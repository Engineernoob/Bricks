## 🧩 Step 1 — Set Up Your Account

Start by signing up for a Bricks account:

```bash
https://buildwitbricks.com
```

Once logged in, you’ll land in the App Dashboard — your control center for projects, APIs, and live deployments.

💡 Tip: You can also use bricks new my-app from the Bricks CLI to scaffold a new project instantly.

🧱 Step 2 — Explore the Visual Builder

Open your new app and you’ll see the Bricks drag-and-drop editor.
Here, every component is a brick — reusable, composable, and fully customizable.

Features

Visual Logic: Create dynamic workflows without code.

Data Sources: Connect to APIs, databases, or Google Sheets.

Custom Components: Mix visual and code components seamlessly.

⚡ Step 3 — Connect Your Data

Bricks makes data connections effortless.

Navigate to Connections → New Source.

Choose your backend (PostgreSQL, REST, Firebase, etc).

Instantly bind data to your UI components.

{
"api": "https://api.example.com",
"method": "GET",
"headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer {{token}}" }
}

🚀 Pro Tip: You can even trigger data updates directly from user actions with built-in state management.

🌐 Step 4 — Deploy in One Click

Once you’re ready, hit Deploy → Bricks Cloud.
Your app is instantly live with built-in scaling, SSL, and CDN edge delivery.

You’ll get a live preview link like:
