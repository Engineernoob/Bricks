## 🧩 Adding a Chart

1. Open your app in the builder.
2. Click **Add → Chart Component**.
3. Connect a **data source** (database, API, or custom JSON).
4. Choose a chart type and style options.

Example:

```json
{
  "type": "bar",
  "data": {
    "labels": ["Q1", "Q2", "Q3", "Q4"],
    "values": [1200, 1800, 950, 2100]
  },
  "style": { "color": "#4f46e5", "rounded": true }
}

🎨 Customizing Charts

Bricks gives full control over design:

Adjust colors, borders, and axis styles

Add interactive hover states

Display legends, tooltips, and data labels

Sync charts with user input for live updates

🔗 Real-Time Data

Charts stay up to date automatically:

Connect to live databases

Subscribe to WebSocket or API streams

Enable auto-refresh intervals

// Example: Live-updating metric
useEffect(() => {
  const socket = new WebSocket("wss://data.bricks.run");
  socket.onmessage = (e) => updateChart(JSON.parse(e.data));
}, []);

📊 Best Practices
